Do you want to create stuff like this? In Skript?

Well then you have come to the right place! 
Skematic is an addon dedicated for adding support for FAWE. With this addon, you can create anything you can do with FAWE.

You can (for example)
- Create almost every shape available (pyramids, circles, lines, etc.)
- Save schematics to files
- Paste schematics
- And a lot more FAWE related stuff!

You can explore the docs here: https://skripthub.net/docs/?addon=Skematic

Want to try out some pre-made syntaxes made by me?

Have fun!
